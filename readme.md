# Hey :wave:


## My name is Philip Edwards, I am studying a web development course with codenation and hope to move into a new career as a junior developer following the completion of this course.:smile::computer:

## Ask me about movies, marvel, Liverpool FC :soccer::trophy:

## 3 months ago you would have found me supporting adults and children with mental health issues.

## To relax if thats possible I will watch a movie, I like most film types but mainly sci-fi, Thriller Marvel and true stories.

## I love going to watch Liverpool play, I'm blessed with three amazing boys and four amazing tickets to each game! pre-covid. :cry:

## I recently learned how to build most of my own house extension with youtube!
